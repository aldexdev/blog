I&rsquo;m a software engineer and project manager specialized in the implementation of Agile methodologies.
I&rsquo;m originally from Madrid, Spain.
I owe much of my professional career to the Web, Open Source and Project Management.

As you can tell, I'm a bit of a geek and a huge video game enthusiast, always willing to keep learning!

### Professional career and experience

I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Polytechnic University of Madrid.
While I was studying, I took several courses on Agile methodologies until, in 2022, I got the Professional SCRUM Master (PSM) certificate.
During this time, I worked on several research projects both in the field of mathematics and software engineering.
It was then that I developed my passion for Javascript and web development.

I have worked as a developer for a few yaers, implementing web tools with Javascript/Typescript, Java and C++,
and as a project manager for as many years, implementing Agile methodologies and managing resources such as Jira/Confluence.

If you want to see more of my personal work you can access my repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/aldexdev)
where you will find open source contributions, web development or programming of Artificial Intelligence models.

### Technical expertise and development tools

I have worked in different areas within the software development industry during my professional career but, without a doubt,
the sector that has filled me the most has been Frontend development and user experience.

I have worked with different development tools such as ReactJS and NextJS, Spring, TailwindCSS, ExpressJS or NodeJS, as well as with different databases such as MongoDB, Postgress, Oracle or MySQL.

The programming language I have used the most is Javascript, although I have also worked with Typescript, C++, Java or Python.
