JavaScript, which holds a significant presence in the global programming world, functions based on a unique execution model.

Let's understand each part of this runtime environment.

## JAVASCRIPT'S EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT

The execution environment, frequently referred to as the JavaScript engine, is a complex space where all the magic of running your JavaScript code happens.
Various browsers and platforms have their specialized engines: V8 powers Google Chrome and Node.js; SpiderMonkey is behind Firefox; JavaScriptCore runs inside Safari.

Within this execution environment, two primary components play important roles in how your code gets executed: the Heap and the Call Stack.

### The Heap

- **Nature**: it is a region of your computer’s memory that is unstructured and provides space for storing variables and instances that your program creates.
- **Dynamics**: when you instantiate a new object or declare a large array, for instance, these are stored in the Heap.
  This allocation happens dynamically, meaning space is allocated or de-allocated as needed during program execution.
- **Garbage Collection**: one significant aspect of the Heap is the “Garbage Collection” mechanism.
  This automatic process identifies when memory is no longer in use and reclaims it.
  It ensures that applications don’t consume memory that isn’t being used, which can otherwise lead to memory leaks and inefficiencies.

### The Call Stack

- **Nature**: the Call Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that records the point in the program where operations are at — basically,
  where functions are called so that execution can return to the correct location once those functions have been executed or if an error is thrown.
- **Dynamics**: when you invoke a function, a new frame (representing that function’s execution context) is pushed onto the Call Stack.
  As the function completes its execution, its frame is popped off the stack, and control returns to where it was invoked.
- **Stack Overflow**: if the Call Stack has too many frames (due to, say, a recursive function that never terminates), it can lead to a stack overflow, and the browser will throw an error.
- **Single-Threaded Nature**: it’s essential to note that JavaScript is single-threaded.
  This means that only one operation is processed at any given moment.
  If a function is being executed, it occupies the Call Stack until it’s done, blocking any other function from executing.

For illustrative purposes:

```js
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

function calculate() {
  const value = multiply(5, 3);
  console.log(value);
}

calculate();
```

In this example:

1. The `calculate()` function is called, placing its frame on the Call Stack.
2. Inside `calculate()`, the `multiply()` function is invoked, adding its frame to the top of the stack.
3. Once `multiply()` completes, it returns the value 15, and its frame is removed from the Call Stack.
4. The `calculate()` function continues its execution and logs the value 15 to the console.
   After it finishes executing, its frame is also popped off the Call Stack.

## JAVASCRIPT'S ASYNCHRONOUS MECHANICS

In a synchronous world, each instruction must wait for the previous one to complete.
However, to deal with operations that might take unpredictable amounts of time (like reading a file or fetching data from a server), JavaScript employs a non-blocking, asynchronous model.
This model is made efficient through a combination of Web APIs, the Callback Queue, and the Event Loop.

### Web APIs

- **Nature**: these are functionalities that the browser (or the environment, in the case of Node.js) provides, which are outside the JavaScript engine but can be accessed using JavaScript.
- **Purpose**: Web APIs handle tasks that would typically be blocking operations if run on the JavaScript engine directly.
  For instance, timers (setTimeout and setInterval), AJAX calls (like fetch), and DOM manipulation tasks are managed here.
- **Interaction**: once a Web API task completes, its callback function is sent to the Callback Queue, ready to be executed.

### Callback Queue

- **Nature**: as the name suggests, it’s a queue (First-In-First-Out structure) that holds all the callback functions that are ready to be executed after their corresponding Web API tasks complete.
- **Dynamics**: callback functions are lined up in this queue in the order in which their associated tasks finish in the Web API.
  However, they don’t automatically move to the Call Stack. That’s the job of the Event Loop.

### Event Loop

- **Role**: its primary role is to monitor both the Call Stack and the Callback Queue.
  If the Call Stack is empty and there’s a function waiting in the Callback Queue, the Event Loop dequeues it and pushes it onto the Call Stack to be executed.
- **Ensuring Non-blocking Behavior**: the Event Loop ensures that JavaScript remains non-blocking.
  Even if an asynchronous operation takes a long time in the Web API, other functions can still run and complete in the Call Stack.

Consider the following code fragment:

```js
console.log("First");
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Second");
}, 0);
console.log("Third");
```

Let's try to find out its output:

1. `console.log('First')` is added to the Call Stack and executed.
2. `setTimeout()` is encountered. The timer operation is handed over to the Web APIs.
3. Immediately after, `console.log('Third')` is added to the Call Stack and executed.
4. Even though the timer duration is 0 milliseconds, the callback of `setTimeout()` (which logs 'Second') is placed in the Callback Queue.
5. The Event Loop, noticing the Call Stack is empty and there’s a function in the Callback Queue, transfers the callback to the Call Stack.
6. Finally, `console.log('Second')` is executed.

Then the output of the code will be:

```js
First
Third
Second
```

This entire mechanism ensures that even for asynchronous code, the program execution flow remains consistent and non-blocking.

Check how the diagram illustrates this case:

### The Microtask Queue

- **Role**: the Microtask Queue contains a list of microtasks, which originate from promises, MutationObserverand other specific asynchronous operations.
- **Priority**: microtasks have a higher priority than tasks. So, after each task is executed, the JavaScript runtime checks the microtask queue,
  and if there are any pending microtasks, it executes all of them before moving on to the next task from the Callback Queue.

In order to understand, consider this example:

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise");
});

console.log("End");
```

The output would be:

```js
Start
End
Promise
setTimeout
```

This order is because, after executing the synchronous code (Start and End),
the event loop sees there’s a promise in the microtask queue and executes that before the `setTimeout()` in the task queue,
even though the `setTimeout()` has a delay of 0.

Let's look at the diagram below.
Note that the Promise is added by the Javascript Engine now since it is a direct promise, not created by fetch, that case it would go first through Web API.

## FINAL ADVICE

As we wrap up, here’s something I would have liked to know when I started working in the world of programming and, in particular, with Javascript:

> Being a great developer isn’t just about writing code. It’s about really understanding how that code works.

When you get how things like the Event Loop, Microtask Queue, and Call Stack work, you’ll feel more connected to your code.
Every piece of code you write will make more sense because you know what’s happening behind the scenes.
