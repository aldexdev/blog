Similar to how Linux, macOS, and Windows make computers easy to use, NEAR protocol is providing a new kind of operating system with [NEAR Discovery](https://github.com/near/near-discovery),
the protocol’s flagship platform that allows individuals to create and use decentralised front-end applications on any blockchain via the [Blockchain Operating System (BOS)](https://bos.gg/).

But first of all, let's start from the beginning...

## WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM

An Operating System (OS) is a critical piece of system software that acts as an intermediary between the computer's hardware and its software applications utilized by users.
It's the core software that manages computer resources, facilitates hardware-software communication, and provides various services for software applications.
Without an operating system, most computers would be difficult to manage and nearly impossible for the average person to use effectively.

## WHAT IS NEAR PROTOCOL

NEAR is a decentralized development platform that uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and will eventually feature a sharded architecture to scale transaction throughput.
Its block generation scheme is called [Doomslug](https://near.org/blog/doomslug-comparison) and its proposed sharding design is dubbed [Nightshade](https://discovery-domain.org/papers/nightshade.pdf#nightshade).
These technologies will work together to scale the network and minimize congestion.

NEAR was originally founded as “NEAR.ai” in 2017 by Illia Polosukhin -engineering manager at Google- and Alexander Skidano -software developer at Microsoft.
The project was dedicated to exploring program synthesis proclaiming -or computer-automated software development.
After trying to build the project on Ethereum, the founders determined that the blockchain’s technology was insufficient for the full vision of the NEAR.ai project.

Hence, in August 2018, the project team began developing the NEAR network to provide developers with easier tools to build scalable decentralized applications.
After nearly two years, NEAR officially launched in April 2020 and performed the last phase of its mainnet launch, enabling token transfers, in October 2020.
Functionalities such as decentralized applications, executing smart contracts, and transacting on the network are all live as a result of achieving mainnet.

NEAR also has a bridge to the famous blockchain network Ethereum, called the Rainbow Bridge and launched in March 2021.

## THE IMPORTANCE OF OPERATING SYSTEMS IN BLOCKCHAINS

Decentralization, while serving as one of crypto’s principal attractions, ironically presents a substantial obstacle in the sector.
The intricacies associated with developing in the Web3 environment -navigating complex languages, binding projects to a specific blockchain with no guarantee of discovery, access issues, security vulnerabilities, composability concerns, and poor user experiences- have imposed substantial barriers to entry for developers.

These issues slow down the growth of crypto and keep more developers and users from getting involved.
As a result, most people are still not using crypto because fewer practical applications are being built.

## BLOCKCHAIN OPERATING SYSTEMS

In response to the challenges faced by developers and users, NEAR introduced the Blockchain Operating System (BOS) on March 2, 2023.
The BOS is an open-source platform that gives developers the ability to build on any blockchain using familiar languages and a broad set of components.
Simultaneously, it provides users the opportunity to connect with various communities and applications while maintaining their data's privacy,
all without the requirement of owning crypto at the start, thus vastly improving the onboarding process.

By offering a unified, interoperable platform, the BOS addresses the complexities often associated with Web3 and the limitations of centralization seen in Web2.
The platform enables seamless interaction across various blockchains, thereby eliminating the complexities associated with token swaps, exchanges, and the management of multiple identities.
Its design emphasizes user accessibility, offering straightforward onboarding processes and improved app discoverability.

### Composition of the BOS

The BOS represents a comprehensive blockchain stack, functioning as a holistic framework for developers and users alike.
Central to its design is the concept of decentralized, composable front ends, a layer that was previously absent in the crypto ecosystem.
These front ends, stored on the blockchain rather than centralized data servers, enable highly composable and censorship-resistant applications.
Developers can fork these front ends wholly or partially to create their applications, akin to Google's Material Design for React but with much broader connectivity and functionality.

A significant advantage of the BOS lies in its potential to break down the tribalism prevalent in crypto today.
By facilitating the construction of consistent experiences across multiple blockchains using easily composable and forkable components, the BOS opens the door to future developers of the open web. Developers can freely access the latest Web3 components from anywhere in the world, enabling them to create new projects, launch DAOs for community-based projects,
and explore a myriad of other possibilities with NEAR. In essence, what smart contracts did for services, Discovery within the BOS is doing for front ends.

The BOS is also defined by its Gateway feature, providing a means to access the BOS functionalities from any point.
While NEAR.org currently acts as a primary gateway, numerous others are being developed and integrated with the BOS.
In essence, the BOS serves as a two-sided platform, catering to both developers and users,
leveraging the advantages of decentralization while mitigating potential drawbacks through its innovative composition.

### Key Features

NEAR’s BOS introduces innovative and robust elements. It aims to enhance the accessibility, discoverability, and functionality of applications in crypto while maintaining a user-friendly experience.
