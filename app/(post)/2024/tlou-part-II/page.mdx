I recently went back to replay the famous sequel to _The Last Of Us_ and I don't know if it's because it's been four years since I first tried it,
but I felt much more drawn to its story, narrative and complex depth than I did then.
In other words, I have been able to confirm firsthand that it is a masterpiece in the world of video games,
an installment ahead of its time and in this post I wanted to share some key points that I think reaffirm what I said above.

## THE PROTECTION OF A LIE

Joel, after the events of the first game, gave Ellie a life, a hope, a home, a family.
He knew he had a second chance after losing everything. He had someone to protect, someone to call "daughter".
Someone to watch grow up and spend time with. Joel lied to keep it all together and, probably because she also needed what Joel could bring to her life,
Ellie accepted that lie without stopping to pursue the truth.
An act that some will label as selfishness, but which is excused by the circumstances in which the protagonists find themselves and the world in which they live.
A lie that benefits both of them. A form of protection.

## ACT AND CONSEQUENCES

By saving Ellie's life, Joel indirectly shattered Abby's, a girl who could not rest in peace until justice was served and the man who killed her father was done away with.
Nothing else matters, not relationships, not even herself. Only revenge.

## THE TRANSIENCE OF TIME

Although Joel wants to give Ellie good memories and quality time, she wastes her time with Joel, the person who is capable of giving everything for her.
At the same time, we are introduced to Abby, who loses the love of her life because of her unquenchable thirst for revenge.
Simply two sides of the same coin, two people who made a mistake and, out of selfishness, did not know what they had until time made them lose it.

## WHO LOVES YOU, WILL MAKE YOU SUFFER

Joel, for his part, does not act in the right way either.
From the very beginning, Ellie tries to uncover the truth and, on several times, she lets Joel know it.
Joel can no longer turn back. He knows that the moment Ellie comes up with that truth, she will suffer.
It finally happens. She realizes that the person she appreciates has betrayed her, that she has lived a lie and accepted it to the point of believing it.

## NOT BEING ABLE TO FORGIVE YOURSELF

Ellie could not forgive Joel in life. Now it's time for her to ask herself why she didn't.
She can't find answers and that's why she travels to Seattle. She does it for her, to find answers, perhaps driven by loneliness, but mostly by a sense of guilt and longing.
It's her way of giving back to Joel everything she couldn't do for him or tell him.
From the beginning she feels she owes him, she has to do it in order to forgive herself.

## A MEMORY FOR ETERNITY

Joel does not die. At least not for Ellie.
Many individuals believe that people live in our memories, and that even if they are gone or have left us, we will always be able to visit them somewhere.
They will always be our special place.

## INTO THE DARKNESS

Ellie plunges deeper and deeper into revenge, dragging everything around her.
She is the sole spectator of her play, a Greek tragedy in which all the characters are doomed to a fatal destiny.
It might seem that the post-apocalyptic world is among the buildings of a devastated United States,
but the most important world based on this style presented to us is, precisely, Ellie's inner world.

## DESTROYING HERSELF

Thus, Ellie starts hunting down each member of Abby's group, further damaging herself physically and emotionally,
in a cycle of violence that seems to have no end.
At this point, Ellie has completely lost sight of her goal and fears that, realizing the monster she is becoming, there is no turning back.

## A REFLECTION OF THE SOUL

The three days Ellie spends in Seattle are a parallelism of her emotional state:
the first is a sunny day that gets darker, the second is that gray dusk that turns into a cold and wet night, and the third is the one that ends with a big storm.

## NO ONE IS SPECIAL

No matter what you have done in the past, or who you are now, you are just another survivor roaming the world and driven by your motivations and moral conflicts.
Neither good nor bad, you are simply what is defined as a human being. That's all.
Your goal: to survive at all costs. If you fail, death awaits you. The cruel and merciless death of a person who is not any kind of a hero.

<Image alt="" src="/images/tlou-part-II/death.jpeg" />

## SOMETHING TO PROTECT

On the other hand, we can see how a parallelism of Joel and Ellie's relationship is formed between Abby and Lev.
They are two very different people, but who need each other.
Two characters who have suffered a lot but, as Joel and Ellie, have created a very strong bond.
From enemies to be a family, to not abandon each other, to start both from zero.
This helps us to empathize with Abby and get to know her better to takes sides with her, if the opportunity arises.

## THE LONELINESS OF THE GROUP

Since she loses the person she loves, Abby is completely isolated. She doesn't feel that she belongs to Isaac's group.
In those 3 days with the enemy, she questions herself if it is really the right thing to do, to the point of risking her life and betraying her group to save Lev.
He is the only person she manages to trust.
On the other hand, Lev finally gets Abby to come to her senses, forgives Ellie and Dina, and decides to move on.

## HUMAN LIFE HAS NO VALUE

This creation shows us graphically how human life is insignificant from the treatment of characters like Jesse or Manny to the death of Mel and Owen.
The lifeless bodies of the people we kill and the trail of blood we leave behind us are not important but a part of the environment of a destroyed world.

## PENANCE FOR THE MISTAKES

Abby and Lev are captured by a group of slavers, Abby suffers a physical and emotional ordeal, although she wants to start from zero and leave behind the path of revenge.
She then realizes that the world continues punishing her, now bearing the cross of her partner's death.

## A TIGHT ROPE

Meanwhile, Ellie has everything, a family, a home, and still she can't be happy, she has a rope tied around her neck that squeezes her more and more,
that doesn't let her breathe, she needs to cut that rope and free herself completely, even if it costs her everything.
Finally, she decides to return to the path of revenge, leaving behind what she has worked so hard to achieve.
Joel's shadow looms over her once again.

## SEE YOU AGAIN

After finishing off the Vipers, Ellie frees the prisoners and is reunited with Abby.
She can't let her go, the wound on her side reminds her of Joel's blood.
She has to close the cycle and write an end for all the oppressive feelings, so she forces Abby to fight against her by appealing to her feelings for Lev.

## FINDING A MEANING

About to kill Abby, wounded and exhausted, Ellie finally gets it all figured out.
She sees Joel reflected in Abby, the way he cares for Lev, the way they need each other.
Killing Abby wasn't going to bring Joel back, wasn't going to heal Ellie's soul, quite the opposite.
It is at that very moment, when Ellie realizes that she has become Joel: she has lied to the love of her life,
she has left everything behind and now she is about to lose everything adding one more victim to her list.

## A BOAT TIED TO THE SHORE

The parallelism of the boat perfectly explains the two protagonists of this story.
The game presented to us two boats: one tied to a pole trying to move forward and stranded in absolute nothingness, representing Ellie.
The other one moves away without leaving a trace, freeing itself from the ties to finally reach the shore, representing Abby.

## DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN

In a final flashback, we see one last conversation Joel has with Ellie.
He confesses to her that, without hesitation, he would relive that whole journey with her, he would make the same mistakes all over again.
Ellie finally understands that she can no longer be angry with him, and wants to forgive him.

The next day Ellie lost the most important person in her life, the one who gave everything for her, the one she treated in a horrible way.
It seems that that clock joke was a reflection of her reality: "consuming time", but not being able to get it back.
She didn't forgive him in time, but it's never too late.

## RETURNING HOME

The symbolism of the guitar leaning against the window, with a moth, an insect which usally looks for the light, the light beyond.
The final farewell and a last goodbye, leaving an empty home. Your home, Joel, symbolized in the guitar.

There is no doubt that _The Last Of Us Part II_ is simply a **work of art** in every way.
The video game shows the harsh reality, but with an incredible and unique message:
take advantage of the time with the people you love, forgive and put yourself in the place of others.
